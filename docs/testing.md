#Testing
The separation of code in this package between Application, Domain and Infrastructure make it easy to (unit) test how your app works with it.
When you want to test the integration of your app with this ElasticVision, it can help you with mocking the raw responses Elasticsearch may give.
It does not fully test the integration with Elasticsearch, but it does allow testing without having a live Elasticsearch instance.
The responses that the Elasticsearch client returns are replaced with fake responses at a low level, meaning that the rest of the application does not need to work with mocks.

Here is an example of a [Laravel feature test](https://laravel.com/docs/testing):

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

namespace Tests\Feature\Api;

use Hilsonxhero\ElasticVision\Infrastructure\Elastic\FakeResponse;
use Tests\TestCase;

class SearchControllerTest extends TestCase
{
    public function test_it_returns_results(): void
    {
        $fakeResponseFile = fopen(base_path("tests/Support/Elastic/Responses/example.json"), 'rb');

        $fakeResponse = new FakeResponse($statusCode, $fakeResponseFile);

        // see https://laravel.com/docs/mocking for more information
        $this->instance(ElasticClientFactory::class, ElasticClientFactory::fake($fakeResponse));

        $response = $this->post('api/search');

        $response->assertStatus(200);
    }
}
```

You can see an example of a raw Elastic response in the tests/Support folder of ElasticVision.
